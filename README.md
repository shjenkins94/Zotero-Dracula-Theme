To use it follow the following steps:

1. Go to your user Profile folder 
   * Windows users: `C:\Users\User_name\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\user_profile.default\`
   * Linux (Flatpak) users: `~/.zotero/zotero/XXXXXXXX.default/`
2. Create a `chrome` folder
3. Place the `userChrome.css` file in there
4. Start Zotero and enjoy


I  encourage everyone to play around with this and try to improve on it and theme things that I didn't manage to. These include the following elements:

* Scrollbars (that is usually done via userContent.css in Firefox but it doesn't work in Zotero)
* New PDF reader
* Note editor (in Zotero 6)
* Menu colors
* Sub-categories in the Preferences dialog. Not satisfied with the preferences dialog but it's the best I could make it


If you wish to explore for additional elements to alter:
1. Go to the folder of my Zotero install (`C:\Programs(x86)\Zotero`) 
2. Copy the zotero.jar folder to another folder
3. Use 7zip to unzip zotero.jar to a zotero folder 
4. Go to `D:\X\zotero\chrome\skin\default\zotero` 
5. Look at ALL .css files in this folder
6. Start testing different pieces of code to change the defaults in the userchrome.css file.

To implement a dark theme in the Note Editor in Zotero 5 (credit to 10cks) follow the subsequent steps:

1. Start Zotero
2. Go to Preferences -> Advanced -> Config Editor
3. Select "I accept the risks!"
4. Search `extensions.zotero.note.css` and double-click it
5. Insert the string in the Note_editor_css.txt file
6. Click "OK" or close the dialog box
7. Restart Zotero.
